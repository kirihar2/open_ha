# Title
Open source high available container images


# Mission
The purpose of this repository is to make open source docker images that are traditionally not Highly available and using existing collections to make them highly available. 

# HA considerations 
The images should be able to handle server/machine failures and auto-recover if possible. Server maintenace/updates are able to be done without down-time.
