# Title
Open source high available container images


# Mission
The purpose of this repository is to make open source docker images that are traditionally not Highly available and using existing collections to make them highly available. 

# HA considerations 
The images should be able to handle server/machine failures and auto-recover if possible. Server maintenace/updates are able to be done without down-time. 

# How to contribute
For new docker image updates, add the following to make the review process smoother. 
1. Add hardware requirements/considerations
  a. For example if the architecture requires 3 physical servers note it down in the description
2. The docker image used for the project
